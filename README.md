# Objective

Inspired by [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iILFBGm_I9M&list=WL&index=22&t=200s), I decided to make a similar app in React-Native. I went off memory and built it from sratch myself, only referencing the video for specific icons or colors used. This app connects to the https://openweathermap.org/api to retrieve the data.
